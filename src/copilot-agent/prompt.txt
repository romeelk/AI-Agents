1st 

i want to call a semantic kernel plugin that takes a string parameter that represents python code generated by the llm. Please use Semantic Kernel agents framework to generate the code

2nd prompt

That is incorrect I want to create two agents. One that manages the creation of python code and uses the plugin to generate a zip file. The second agent should then take the output of the first agent and use it to pass the zip file path to a deploy code function in the plugin. The agent should use AgentGroupChat to achieve this.
